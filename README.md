# PHP DataMappers Benchmark

## Overview
This repository contains benchmarks for some of the most popular PHP DataMapper's, used as a reference for performance 
optimizations in my personal project [compositephp/db](https://github.com/compositephp/db). 

The projects benchmarked include:
- [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/)
- [Laravel Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent)
- [Cycle ORM](https://cycle-orm.dev/)
- [Composite DB](https://github.com/compositephp/db/)

## Methodology
* The benchmark executes 10 000 CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to assess the performance.
* The benchmark tests focus exclusively on the 'DataMapper' component of each project, employing simple queries that do 
not involve relationships, foreign keys, or joins.

Operations include:
1. Creating a new record in the database.
2. Reading the record by primary key.
3. Updating one field for the found record.
4. Deleting the record.

### Database
- MySQL 8.0
- Table used for the benchmark:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users
(
    `id` INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `age` INTEGER NOT NULL,
    `microtime` FLOAT NOT NULL,
    `created_at` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

## Running Locally

### Requirements
* PHP 8.1+
* Docker
* Composer
* PDO_MySQL extension

### Steps
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `composer update`
3. Execute `docker-compose up`
4. Run benchmarks for each DataMapper separately:
   * `php src/test-laravel.php`
   * `php src/test-cycle.php`
   * `php src/test-doctrine.php`
   * `php src/test-composite.php`

## Note
This is a synthetic benchmark focused on speed and memory consumption and does not compare the feature list of the projects.
